# Memory for RL

To reproduce the experiments in the Eigen Memory Tree paper execute either ~/study1/run_bounded.py or ~/study1/run_unbounded.py. 

These experiments assume that the VW source at https://github.com/mrucker/vowpal_wabbit/ is installed in the current Python environment.

After running the experiments analysis and plotting can be found in ~/study1/plots.ipynb.
